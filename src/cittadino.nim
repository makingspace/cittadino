## cittadino: a simple, opinionated pubsub framework
## =================================================
##
## *cittadino* is a simple, small library that implements a pubsub system over STOMP.
##
## It exposes a single main object type, ``PubSub``, with its constructor,
## ``newPubSub()``, which provides two main procs: ``publishModelEvent()`` and
## ``subscribe()``. These procedures take care of publishing and subscribing,
## respectively. Subscriber procedures can be registered with ``subscribe()``
## to certain AMQP/STOMP-style topic patterns, and arbitrary JSON messages can
## be sent to routing keys with ``publishModelEvent()``.
##
## In order process incoming events, call ``run()`` inside of a process. That
## process will loop and block, waiting for incoming messages. Any topics that
## match the patterns that were registered with ``subscribe()`` will have their
## messages passed to the handler procedures.
